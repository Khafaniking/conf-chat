# conf-chat
A P2P Chat

Created a very basic P2P messaging simulation using ZeroMQ and Python. Just a few ports I've set aside/set up are able to talk with each other in a Public Chat, and are able to DM each other via commands and selecting the port/address of their intended recipient.

Had planned to implement creating group chats and enabling a sort of "peeking" feature, where one player would be randomly able to view the DMs of the other members of the public chat and eavesdrop on their communications, but had issues with these and just scaled back to the public chat and DM feature.
